863,"At this time Enron Portland has 5 parking spots allocated based on floor space and number of employees.  As UBS employees leave we do not automatically have the ability to take over their spots.  However, in renegotiating our lease with PGE we will address the possibility of taking over more that the 5 allocated spots.  We will keep you updated as to the progress of this.  For now, Khymberly Booth is checking into the availability of 1 or more of our spots and will offer any available spots to Portland employees based on Portland office seniority.  We will contact you individually if a spot becomes available.

1116,"     As per our conversation last week, I just wanted to double check on a potential raise before the deal closes on Friday. I know that more than a few non-promotional raises have been offered and accepted for the transfer to UBS, and I'd like to make absolutely sure that I'm not eligible for one. As Cowan says, potentially the bonus pool may be much bigger next year, which is great, but it's not for sure. And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.",188.txt,no_entity,655,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,114.0,0,655,2,4,2,1,3,0,0,1,1,0.5,0.5,0.75,5.745614035087719,1.0,0,1,0,0

1399,"Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions...
