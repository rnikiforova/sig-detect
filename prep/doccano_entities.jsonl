I understand that a memo with respect to this issue likely was forwarded to ECC by Chris Christopher and John Eamon on January 8, 2002 ( a copy of which is attached), which set out that based on our review of the contracts, the following parties and their proper termination dates are:\n\nAEC Marketing, physical, gas  - February 1, 2002\nCalpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical, gas - February 1, 2002\nEl Paso Merchant Energy, physical gas - February 1, 2002\nWilliams Energy Marketing & Trade Co. - February 1, 2002\n\nOur review last night also revealed the following:\nBaytex physical, gas- ECC list says terminated January 6/02, but the January 4/02 letter from ECC set a termination date of January 8/02, which is reflected in the Chart\n\nMarathon Canada Limited physical, gas - ECC list says terminated December 18/01, however the chart suggests that this was revised by a letter from ECC, sent December 31, 01, changing the termination date to January 4/02.  Chris Christopher recalls the letter, but we do not have a copy of that letter.\n\nCalpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Orbit) physical, gas - we have reviewed the contract and determined that the chart is incorrect.  It has been changed from February 1/02 to December 18/01, as set out in the ECC list.\n\nI understand that you have reviewed the Cinergy contract and determined the reason for the discrepancy in that instance.\n\nWe continue our review of a couple of entries, namely Canadian Natural Resources, Talisman Energy Inc, and Dynegy Canada.

Policy since 9/11 relative to P=\nakistan has been indicative of the evolving Washington calculus; experience=\n of sustained weakness and unexpected shock of 9/11 has revealed that conta=\ngion is a secondary driver right now\nDifferentiation between BA and Sao Paulo: Decoupling of Brazilian Real and =\nC-Bond from Argy Peso NDFs and FRB in currency and bond markets continues t=\no strengthen the base policy bias of quarantine/reinforce relative to BA an=\nd SP, as has relative flight to quality in the EM asset class that has been=\n seen over the last few weeks, most notably in case of Mexico =20\nAnother waiting game vis-?-vis Argy: Despite the 'effective default' condit=\nions in Argy and a new spate of downgrades, the once again much rumored swa=\np/restructure is by no means a settled issue, and even if/once achieved sti=\nll leaves open the underlying problem of the peso-$ peg, w/ a dollarization=\n above parity scenario still lurking.  As with the saga all year, this is p=\nrimarily a political drama being conveyed through economic channels\nOil in the policy mix: Collapse and continuing pressure in oil market will =\nexpose and exacerbate underlying fault-lines both within OPEC and between O=\nPEC and non-OPEC producers: apart from obviously more visible Russian role,=\n this will continue build in a focus on regional players inside and outside=\n the cartel: Venezuela (including internal Chavez dynamic, Venezuela within=\n OPEC, and price v. market share debate) and Mexico, incl. relative to West=\nern Hemisphere supply security.  The end of the Congressional year in DC, w=\nar politics, and the upcoming OPEC meeting next week will continue to contr=\nibute near term volatility\nDomestic US politics: Current breakdown of post-9/11 bipartisan consensus n=\now in full throat as appropriations and special needs bills are facing prob=\nlems in committees, on the floors of both chambers and/or in the face of a =\nconferencing.  Of particular importance at this time is the Senate Finance =\nCommittee's consideration of a stimulus bill.  The lack of progress, despit=\ne an attempt late last week by the White House to bring more executive pres=\nsure to bear, has led to concern that a final stimulus bill may not be read=\ny until just before Christmas, and there remains a danger that no stimulus =\nbill will go through.  A new wrinkle in this drama is the effort by Alaskan=\n Sens. Stevens and Murkowski to potentially attach an energy bill, includin=\ng ANWR drilling, to any Senate stimulus bill, focusing on national security=\n interests in order to sway moderates.  Given that the markets have already=\n priced in a stimulus bill by around thanksgiving and on the order of $100B=\n, there is downside risk in delay or defeat.  These dangers have been heigh=\ntened further over the past week as weak data has come in even weaker than =\nexpected, putting a further premium on a sooner, more dramatic recovery\n\nLet me know if this is helpful and if there are any macroecon or political =\nspecifics that you are particularly concerned about.=20\n\n\nRegards,\nBrendan\nx54763", "labels": [[516, 519, "url"], [3721, 3726, "phone"], [6, 11, "PERSON"], [33, 40, "GPE"], [57, 71, "LOC"], [76, 86, "GPE"], [93, 101, "GPE"], [169, 178, "GPE"], [184, 197, "LOC"], [398, 407, "ORG"], [417, 420, "PERSON"], [444, 452, "ORG"], [544, 546, "GPE"], [551, 553, "GPE"], [555, 564, "GPE"], [583, 589, "GPE"], [602, 605, "ORG"], [623, 629, "GPE"], [634, 643, "GPE"], [679, 686, "PERSON"], [723, 733, "GPE"], [894, 896, "ORG"], [901, 910, "GPE"], [959, 968, "ORG"], [978, 981, "ORG"], [1094, 1096, "ORG"], [1103, 1105, "ORG"], [1233, 1239, "GPE"], [1275, 1279, "PERSON"], [1329, 1333, "ORG"], [1470, 1474, "PERSON"], [1831, 1835, "ORG"], [1848, 1851, "ORG"], [1851, 1854, "ORG"], [1863, 1867, "ORG"], [1996, 2004, "GPE"], [2018, 2027, "GPE"], [2048, 2054, "PERSON"], [2064, 2081, "PERSON"], [2083, 2087, "ORG"], [2127, 2133, "GPE"], [2135, 2139, "GPE"], [2159, 2173, "ORG"], [2229, 2231, "GPE"], [2266, 2270, "ORG"], [2349, 2351, "GPE"], [2488, 2493, "ORG"], [2631, 2637, "ORG"], [2756, 2771, "ORG"], [3040, 3047, "PERSON"], [3052, 3061, "PERSON"], [3134, 3140, "ORG"], [3177, 3186, "ORG"], [3255, 3263, "ORG"], [3712, 3719, "PERSON"], [3720, 3726, "PERSON"]]}

{"text": "I would see the primary responsibilities:\n\n\n1. Develop with Fallon a written process for the valuation of terminated contracts.  We will most likely only have Bjorn for a short period of time given his reluctance to go to NETCO.  While no one appears to care about the fact that we have no way to render a correct value for financial statement purposes, this would be a priority if I was managing the estate.   There is no metric for the approval of comprises internally.  Our curves say one value, the counterparties quotes say another.  Differences in value may be a better metric that notional settlement amounts.\n2. With IT, assure that the terminated contracts are frozen in value.   The book is currently floating, rendering an open position which is unmeasured as to VaR.  Examine ways, if any, to manage this uncovered market risk. \n3. Valuation of assets held for sale and DASH process.   It would appear that we should work backwards from the summary of sale that the Unsecured Creditors Committee wants.   There have already been complaints about multiple forms (DASH, transaction review committee for).  This would require revamping the DASH process and TAP.   \n4. Revaluation of International assets.\n5. To the extent EES performs post petition, value this book and the associated  ongoing costs associated with it.\n6. My understanding is that the billing on performing accounts is behind. Manage and develop a process to collect these past due amounts.  Collectibility does not improve with time.\n7. Ongoing review of business unit's cash requests.\n8. Develop a systematized IT solution to payments and transfers made 90 days prior to bankruptcy (in process).\n9. Manage the bankrupt counterparty portfolio.\n10. Collect amounts owed by PG&E and So Cal Edison ($545 million notional).\n11.

{"text": "Rob,\n\nMarkets\nMy marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today, considering neighboring markets, transmission/wheeling costs, and fuel costs.  More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.\n\nThe market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  \n\nAs a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.\n\nPeak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\n\n\nStaffing and Services\n\nTrading\nOn the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\n\nOrigination\nThis is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  \n\nIT\nImplementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \n\nLet's get on these issues as soon as possible.\n\nOn specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. \n\nOffice Space\nTembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\n\nPotential Conflict of Interest\nI would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted.\n\nAs time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. \n\nThank you\nGarrett", "labels": [[322, 328, "phone"], [229, 236, "GPE"], [777, 784, "GPE"], [1078, 1087, "PERSON"], [1151, 1154, "ORG"], [1230, 1271, "ORG"], [1294, 1298, "ORG"], [1303, 1321, "PERSON"], [1361, 1380, "PERSON"], [1451, 1465, "PERSON"], [1467, 1479, "PERSON"], [1484, 1491, "PERSON"], [1605, 1616, "PERSON"], [1756, 1760, "ORG"], [1782, 1793, "PERSON"], [1845, 1848, "ORG"], [1967, 1980, "PERSON"], [2051, 2057, "ORG"], [2117, 2131, "PERSON"], [2132, 2135, "ORG"], [2170, 2177, "GPE"], [2289, 2298, "PERSON"], [2303, 2316, "PERSON"], [2333, 2339, "PERSON"], [2782, 2794, "ORG"], [2898, 2904, "ORG"], [2908, 2911, "ORG"], [3009, 3016, "GPE"], [3026, 3037, "ORG"], [3180, 3183, "ORG"], [3288, 3295, "GPE"], [3325, 3332, "PERSON"]]}

{"text": "Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  \n1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)\n2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.\n3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. \n4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.\n4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.\n5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow \"form of agreement\".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.

There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  \n\n2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.\n\n3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  \n\n4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.

{"text": "Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  \n1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)\n2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.\n3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. \n4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.\n4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.\n5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow \"form of agreement\".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. \n6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   \n\nWe'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.\n\njeff", "labels": [[0, 4, "PERSON"], [37, 42, "ORG"], [59, 61, "ORG"], [119, 141, "ORG"], [154, 156, "ORG"], [166, 171, "GPE"], [178, 181, "PERSON"], [210, 213, "PERSON"], [278, 287, "PERSON"], [319, 332, "PERSON"], [351, 354, "PERSON"], [438, 441, "ORG"], [476, 479, "PERSON"], [1155, 1166, "PERSON"], [1325, 1328, "PERSON"], [1352, 1354, "ORG"], [1543, 1545, "ORG"], [1803, 1814, "PERSON"], [1817, 1830, "PERSON"], [2037, 2040, "PERSON"], [2042, 2049, "PERSON"], [2053, 2061, "PERSON"]]}

There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  \n\n2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.\n\n3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  \n\n4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.\n\n5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.\n\njeff", "labels": [[96, 115, "PERSON"], [476, 484, "ORG"], [567, 572, "ORG"], [706, 709, "ORG"], [722, 727, "ORG"], [995, 998, "ORG"], [1029, 1031, "ORG"], [1072, 1077, "ORG"], [1149, 1152, "ORG"], [1177, 1182, "PERSON"]]}

Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.\n\t4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.

Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn't always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting. \n\nLeader\t\n\nPick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible. \nBe prompt and end on time. \nConduct a roll call. \nFor large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they're queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call. \nTo share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don't jump ahead. \nIf a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail. \n\nLeader & Participants\t\n\nSpeak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise. \nIdentify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name. \nUse your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace. \nUse the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself. \n\nReceive a Free Web RSVP!\nEffective February 1, schedule a domestic attended-level audioconference or Net conference, add Instant Replay PlusSM, and you'll receive a free Web RSVP -- up to $100!* Instant Replay Plus allows individuals who missed your meeting access to a digital recording that they can listen to at their convenience. Web RSVP is our Internet-based registration tool that allows conference leaders to collect and view participant information online.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\n\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\n\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\n\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\n\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\n\nTraders and Originators:\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\n\nInformation Technology:\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\n\n\nNext steps \n\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \n\n\nRegards,\nDave Forster\n713.853.1861\nE-Mail:\tDavid.Forster@enron.com", "labels": [[2927, 2950, "email"], [2927, 2940, "url"], [309, 315, "phone"], [64, 74, "ORG"], [164, 169, "ORG"], [170, 173, "ORG"], [864, 867, "ORG"], [1777, 1799, "ORG"], [2345, 2355, "ORG"], [2672, 2690, "ORG"], [2699, 2709, "ORG"], [2843, 2853, "PERSON"], [2893, 2905, "PERSON"], [2927, 2950, "ORG"]]}

The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.\nEnron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.\nEnron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up.", "labels": [[43, 48, "ORG"], [83, 88, "ORG"], [114, 137, "ORG"], [139, 150, "ORG"], [210, 221, "ORG"], [495, 500, "ORG"], [661, 666, "ORG"], [763, 801, "ORG"], [866, 871, "ORG"], [953, 958, "ORG"]]}

I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company\nand left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives\nEnron and what the company seeks in its applicants.  Your responses to my\nquestions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.\n\nAs you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and\nElectronic Commerce.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in\nMay of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I\nreceived an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge\nin August of 1995.\n\nAfter graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as\nan analyst in its Financial Development Program.  Most recently, I worked as\nan investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major\nbusiness development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44\nmillion and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of\nThomson's key competitors.  I also performed strategic, market, and\ncompetitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's\noverall competitiveness.  My professional experiences working in the High\nTechnology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a\ncomplete redefinition of my career goals.  I much prefer to be on the front\nlines of business, helping some of the world's most established\norganizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and\ncompetitive position in the market.   I am anxious to begin my career with\nEnron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually\nbeneficial.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in\nNashville.
