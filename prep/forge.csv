88,            Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.

He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.

176,"Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.

366,"The basic operation of a one way payment provision is that, if the defaulting party has a net in-the-money position based upon the Early Termination Damages calculation, the Early Termination Damages are deemed to be zero and the non-defaulting party is not required to pay that amount to the defaulting party (the defaulting party's position is wiped out).  However, we would still be entitled, prior to default, to call for collateral where a counterparty's out-of-the money position is in excess of its collateral threshold, which would provide us with security to ensure the counterparty continues to pay.  In addition, if the counterparty failed to post such collateral, they would be in default, we could terminate the contract and, as the non-defaulting party, we would be in a position to realize on our in-the-money position.  If, after we received the collateral, we were then to become insolvent or otherwise default under the master, the counterparty could terminate the contract, our mark-to-market position would be wiped out and we would be required to return any unused collateral.",127_body,no_entity,1097,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,T,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,176.0,0,1432,6,16,1,1,8,0,0,0,1,0.6363636363636364,0.36363636363636365,0.875,6.232954545454546,0.7660614525139665,0,1,0,0

368,"The operation of a two way payment provision is that the early termination damages are calculated by the non-defaulting party and whoever has a net in-the-money position based upon such calculation is owed the termination payment, regardless of whether such party is the defaulting or non-defaulting party.  In other words, unlike a one way payment, if the defaulting party has a net in-the-money position upon termination of the contract, the non-defaulting party will be required to pay that amount to the defaulting party.  Therefore, if we were to become insolvent or otherwise default under a master and we had a net in-the-money position under that master, the counterparty could terminate the contract but we would still be owed our mark-to-market position.  The other point to consider in the situation where there is a two way payment provision is that, of the three counterparty masters above that contain two way payments, all three also contain cherry picking language that, upon the occurrence of an event of default other than insolvency, allows the non-defaulting counterparty to pick and choose which transactions to terminate.  In other words, the counterparty need not terminate all transactions, which could effect the amount otherwise owed to the defaulting party.  Even with cherry-picking, upon the occurrence of an insolvency, all transactions are deemed to terminate, so cherry picking would not be a factor.",127_body,no_entity,1432,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,T,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,176.0,0,1432,6,16,1,1,6,0,0,0,1,0.7272727272727273,0.2727272727272727,1.0,8.136363636363637,1.0,0,1,0,0

1158,"Tag 23841 was cut by 50 MW for HE 01 and HE 02.  Wally @ NEVP said he heard of the cut @ 23:30 on 06/27/01 but he neglected to call us and tell us about the cut.  The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about the cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing power on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with PSCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO and PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PSCO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing happened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought back for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.  The deals are in the RT Inc. sheet for the 28th of June.  After the fact, I spoke with Ryan @ PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE 01 and HE 02 on the MEAD 230 part of the transaction (06:00 on Kate Symes Phone).",39_body,no_entity,1120,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,T,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,149.0,0,1120,4,4,1,1,5,0,0,0,1,0.375,0.625,0.75,7.516778523489933,1.0,0,1,0,0

1275,There is a day ahead schedule cut coming out of the ISO for 09/02/01.  Duke is exporting @ Mead 230 and selling to us where we are selling to NEVP Marketing for the sink.  The cut was for HE 24 only 50mw cut to 1mw.  Duke is going to resubmit the schedule on a real time issue.  The old tag was 31482.  I terminated this tag and Duke created a new tag to reflect the cut.  The new tag number is rt0902a.  If for some reason they get cut for he 24 you will need to make sure  they resupply the schedule from another source in the desert.--Bert Meyers,50_body,no_entity,549,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,T,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,549.0,549,549,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,0

2482,"Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.",97_body,no_entity,1083,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,A,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,365.0,0,1083,1,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.5,2.967123287671233,1.0,0,1,0,0
