      "I spoke with Judge Young earlier today and was told that entities that\n",
      "are not yet intervenors in the Northeast RTO proceeding may attend the\n",
      "meeting next Tuesday. Initially, the Judge will poll parties present as\n",
      "to their status. Those that are already intervenors in the underlying\n",
      "dockets need do nothing more, they are considered intervenors to the\n",
      "RT01-99 proceeding already. Those who are not already intervenors will\n",
      "be admitted as parties, provided there are no objections. If there are\n",
      "any objections, the objecting party(ies) and the party seeking\n",
      "admittance will be given a brief opportunity to state their cases and\n",
      "the Judge will issue a ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to filing for party status with the Commission, it is still not clear\n",
      "(and the Judge did not provide guidance) whether parties should file \"in\n",
      "time\" in docket RT01-99 or \"out of time\" in one of the underlying RTO\n",
      "dockets. The safest bet might be to file under both. In either case, the\n",
      "mediation process may well be concluded before FERC acts on such\n",
      "intervention requests. Thus, attending the meeting and resolving party\n",
      "status at that time would seem to provide the quickest, surest answer.\n",
      "However, I'm not a lawyer and that is not legal advice.... ;-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, my understanding is that, regardless of how many days the rooms\n",
      "are reserved for, the meeting next week is for two days only, Tuesday\n",
      "and Wednesday. The substance of the mediation meetings, once\n",
      "interventions are sorted out, will be to develop a business plan,\n",
      "milestones and timeline -- in short a process -- for developing a region\n",
      "wide RTO. It does not appear that substantive answers to the myriad\n",

      "Posted Friday December 21, 2001 @ 03:55 PT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington running back Stephen Davis has been remarkably durable this\n",
      "season. He heads into his 14th game of the season and hasn't missed a game\n",
      "so far, the first time in the past two seasons he has been able to do that.\n",
      "However, Davis -- listed as questionable this week with a bruised knee -- is\n",
      "clearly showing signs of wearing down after hauling the rock 275 times this\n",
      "season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davis, who sat out Wednesday's workout all together, only took part in\n",
      "portions of Thursday's practice. Nonetheless, head coach Marty\n",
      "Schottenheimer told reporters he expects the tailback to practice fully\n",
      "Friday before starting and playing as usual against the Bears this Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, no one can be sure how his knee will hold up against one of the\n",
      "more punishing defenses in the league.\n",
      "\n",
      "That could be a problem because Ki-Jana Carter is still bothered by a sore\n",
      "shoulder. Carter has had just six carries in the past three games. The team\n",
      "will need to get more out of him this week because Davis is likely to need\n",
      "more rest than usual. ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the case might be, the Redskins desperately need Davis to carry the\n",
      "load. So far this season the Redskins are 3-1 when he gains 100 yards. Given\n",
      "the fact that quarterback Tony Banks has tailed off the last couple weeks,\n",
      "Washington is geared towards running 40 times against Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's going to be physical,\" Davis said yesterday. \"We've got to go do what\n",
      "we do best: Control the clock [and] keep their offense off the field.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Redskins have been doing what they do best especially well the past two\n",
      "weeks with Davis, whose 1,116 yards rank third in the NFL, racking up 110\n",
      "yards at Arizona on Dec. 9 and 111 yards against the Eagles last weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington ranks a solid 10th in the NFL in rushing offense (115.8 yards),\n",
      "and that figure would be even higher if the club hadn't struggled so badly\n",
      "during an 0-5 start. The Redskins have averaged 135.9 rushing yards over the\n",
      "past nine games; for the season, only one team averages more (Pittsburgh,\n",
      "174.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bears, on the other hand, have held opponents to less than 100 yards on\n",
      "the ground eight times this season, including Tampa Bay last weekend (61\n",
      "yards on 18 carries). And Chicago has only allowed two running plays of 20\n",
      "yards or more this season (Davis has six such runs this season).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My thing is, we've got to go in there and see what's going to work,\" Davis\n",
      "said. \"We'll run some plays, see what works against them and just play\n",
      "hard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that two of Chicago's last four opponents have topped the\n",
      "100-yard mark, including Green Bay two weeks ago. That day the Packers\n",
      "rushed for 167 yards in a 17-7 victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Redskins believe they could have similar success. They don't want to\n",
      "belittle the Bears' ranking or reputation, but they're ready to test the\n",
      "Bears primary strength\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our identity is to run the ball,\" tight end Walter Rasby said. \"We're a\n",
      "running offense. We take pride in what we do best. It's not anything about\n",
      "the Bears are coming to town, saying this or saying this. We do what we do.\n",
      "They do what they do. It's going to be a good, physical football game up\n",
      "front.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*************  Our View  *************\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that I'd add to this would be the Bears have not played as\n",
      "well on rush defense lately as they had earlier in the season.   They did\n",
      "hold Tampa Bay down last week and they did limit Detroit to 67 yards rushing\n",
      "in week 12.  But they also gave up 124 yards rushing to Minnesota and a\n",
      "whopping 167 yards rushing to Green Bay two weeks ago.   They are very good\n",
      "but in my opinion, they're not in the \"shut down\" category of rushing\n",
      "defenses like Pittsburgh is this year or Baltimore was last year.   In fact,\n",
      "over the last 4 weeks, they rank # 16 in the league.   I think they're\n",
      "better than that but clearly some teams have recently had success against\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll know more after Friday's practice but wanted to shoot this to you now.\n",
      "Also, don't understimate the impact of Ki-Jana Carter's injury.   Without a\n",
      "solid alternative, Davis may be asked to do more than he would if Carter was\n",
      "100%.\n",

      "Arthur Andersen and one of the plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed on a proposed order for preserving documents. Other plaintiffs' lawyers said that the agreed order was not stringent enough. \n",
      "With respect to Enron, there is some doubt as to whether the court can enter any order regarding Enron, because that may be the exclusive purview of the bankruptcy court. \n",
      "Although the issue of which attorney should be appointed lead counsel was not technically before the court, most of the hearing was consumed with the various plaintiffs' lawyers arguing that the court should select them to be lead counsel. \n",
      "The court said that it would not rule on the motion regarding preservation of documents until after 3:00 tomorrow. All of the plaintiffs' lawyers are to get together in the next 24 hours to see if they can agree amongst themselves as to what they want the court to do. The court said she would also consider whether Arthur Andersen was willing to agree to whatever order plaintiffs' all might agree upon.\n",
      "The judge suggested that she would be selecting the lead plaintiff (and counsel) within the next few weeks. \n",

      "I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.\n",

      "6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For\n",
      "instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a \"hot\" topic\n",

      "November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting\n",
      "weak and glum.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like\n",
      "yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to\n",
      "aggravate that situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal\n",
      "Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers\n",
      "are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is\n",
      "familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities\n",
      "are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part\n",
      "with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report\n",
      "dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called\n",
      "G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview\n",
      "1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "This poll was given to me by someone close to the Fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\"\n",
      "to purchase a car or a house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\"\n",
      "making a major purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75\n",
      "percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist\n",
      "attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated\n",
      "because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but\n",
      "buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans\n",
      "refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and\n",
      "our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of\n",
      "those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a\n",
      "few months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cut is\n",
      "expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it\n",
      "announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting\n",
      "them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in\n",
      "previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank\n",
      "because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like\n",
      "mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy\n",
      "hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the\n",
      "surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what\n",
      "Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are\n",
      "feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What will yesterday's incident do to confidence?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what\n",
      "happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like\n",
      "this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being\n",
      "weak in the knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street\n",
      "was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane\n",
      "crash, but snapped back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and\n",
      "the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this\n",
      "overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are\n",
      "getting greater.\n",

With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\n",

      "The Council on American Islamic Relations is stirring up a tempest in a teapot over a Christmas Day incident in which an American Airlines pilot refused to allow an armed Arab-American Secret Service agent on his flight. \"American Airlines said it prevented the agent from flying because of discrepancies in the standard forms he filled out identifying himself as an armed law enforcement officer and it denied that the decision was related to his ethnicity,\" Reuters reports. When his papers checked out, he took another flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the pilot's fears proved to be unwarranted in this instance, his cautious approach strikes us as eminently sensible. As the  San Francisco Chronicle  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/12/28/MN60124.DTL  reports:\n",

      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal probe conducted last year shows that concern about bogus law enforcement credentials is justified. Undercover inspectors using fake law enforcement credentials and badges \"readily available\" on the Internet were able to declare themselves \"armed law enforcement officers\" and skirt security checkpoints at 19 federal agencies--including the CIA, FBI and Pentagon--and two airports, according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress which conducted the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At no time time during the undercover visits were our agents' bogus credentials or badges challenged by anyone,\" Robert Hast, the GAO's special investigations chief, told Congress last year. Working in teams of two or three, the agents were able to get minivans and satchels that could have been packed with explosives and biological agents past checkpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agents were waved around metal detectors at Washington's Reagan National Airport and Orlando (Florida) Airport after presenting tickets issued in their undercover aliases and fake credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our agents could thus have carried weapons, explosives, chemical/biological agents, or other dangerous objects onto aircraft,\" GAO manager Gerald Dillingham warned a Senate committee on Sept. 20, nine days after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon.\n",
      "\n",

      "In a typically hysterical  press release  http://cair-net.org/asp/article.asp?articleid=559&articletype=3 , CAIR \"demanded an apology from American Airlines for removing a Muslim Secret Service agent from a flight apparently based on religious and ethnic profiling\":\n",
      "\n",
      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "In a letter faxed today to American Chairman Donald J. Carty, CAIR wrote: \"We are concerned that American Airlines would arbitrarily deny boarding to a Muslim passenger, particularly someone who has one of our nation's highest security clearances, merely because of his religion or ethnicity. The passengers on Flight 363 would actually have been more secure had Agent ------ been allowed to board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*** END QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to keep the agent off the plane may have been erroneous, but it was hardly \"arbitrary.\" After all, he was carrying a gun!\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident may point to a need for the Secret Service and other law-enforcement agencies to work with airlines on improving ID procedures to avoid future such incidents. But why in the world is this issue being raised publicly by a group like CAIR, which has an agenda other than the enforcement of laws and protection of American security?\n",
      "\n",
      "CAIR claims to know the identity of the agent in question, which has not been reported in the press; \"for security reasons, CAIR is not releasing his name,\" the press release says. Did the agent take his grievance to CAIR instead of his superiors at the Secret Service? If so, this strikes us as conduct ill befitting a law-enforcement agent. A Secret Service man is supposed to be prepared to take a bullet for the president. Is it too much to ask that he take a later flight?\n",

      "ABC  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/airplane_explosives011228.html ,  CNN  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/27/inv.reid/index.html  and the  Times of London  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570018-2001601809,00.html  all have accounts of alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid's activities over the past year. For a loser who worked as a dishwasher in Amsterdam, he sure seems to have been loaded. \"French intelligence officials have tracked Reid's movements over the last year, saying he traveled to Israel, Egypt, the Netherlands and Belgium, spending money freely, though he did not seem to have the income to fund the trips,\" ABC reports. CNN has more on the Israel junket:\n",
      "\n",
      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli Security Services, in conjunction with the FBI, are looking into what Reid did during a 10-day trip to the country in July, Israeli government sources told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reid roused suspicion when he traveled from an unidentified country to Israel on its national airline, El Al, according to airline spokesman Nahman Klaiman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our security people were aroused and [Reid] went through a security check, which included a personal check as well as removal of his shoes, which were checked separately,\" Klaiman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "*** END QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "Reid was in Amsterdam from August through November, then went to Brussels Dec. 5 and Paris Dec. 16. \"A day later, he paid 13,000 French francs (about $1,750) in cash at a Myream Voyage, a travel agency on the rue des Poisoniers in the 18th arrondissement, or section, in Paris for a two-way plane ticket from Paris to Miami to Antigua.\" On Dec. 22 he tried to fly from Paris to Miami--and ended up instead in a federal prison in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Times adds Turkey, Pakistan \"and possibly Afghanistan\" to Reid's itinerary. The paper cites Israeli intelligence officials who are concerned \"that the Islamic fanatic may have tried to make contact with Hamas terrorists who are now known to have developed recent links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.\" The Times also adds this intriguing detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 7 [Reid] travelled to Brussels and stayed a week, during which time he obtained a new British passport from the UK consulate there. His previous passport, which had pages torn out of it, was affixed to the new one, which police believe was Mr Reid's clumsy way of trying to disguise where he had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israeli visa stamp was still in the old document, as was the Pakistani visa.\n",
      "\n",
      "*** END QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the ABC report, \"Government officials told The Associated Press the nonmetal fuses for the explosives allegedly in Reid's shoes may have become wet, and been too moist to light, preventing him from detonating the charges.\" All this suggests the Reid may not be the brightest candle on the birthday cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "His Dad Is Bad, but His Mom Is Mum  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570018-2001602513,00.html\n",
      "\n",
      "The Times of London also has some details about Reid's upbringing, and in several important respects it resembles that of Marin mujahid John Walker. Like Walker, Reid is a child of divorce, his parents having split when he was four. Also like Walker, Reid had paternal support for his \"spiritual journey\"; as the Times put it: \"Mr Reid said that he had encouraged his son to join the faith because he felt it rejected violence.\" And like Walker, Reid has a father who is eager to make excuses for him now: \"My son is a determined boy and I can imagine him being determined enough to blow himself to bits,\" the elder Reid tells the Times. \"But I just can't believe that he would want to hurt anyone else in doing it unless, that is, he has been brainwashed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two differences: Whereas Walker's father is a lawyer, Reid's is a common criminal. \"He was absent for much of Richard's childhood after spending time in prison for a series of car thefts and burglaries.\" And unlike Walker's mother, Reid's mom, Lesley Hughes, has comported herself with dignity since her son's arrest.  Reuters  http://sg.news.yahoo.com/reuters/asia-80865.html  quotes a statement released through Hughes's lawyers: \"As any mother would be, she is deeply shocked and concerned about the allegations made against her son, but has no further comment to make.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The London Telegraph, in an article on Reid, has a telling quote from Abdul Haqq Baker, the moderate chairman of the Brixton mosque, where Reid and \"20th hijacker\" Zacarias Moussaoui worshipped before taking a more militant route:\n",
      "\n",
      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Baker said: \"We have a lot of converts and ex-convicts. Many just turn up with their bags straight from prison. They come because we are tolerant and we teach in English. But because they are new to Islam they can be easily led. Extremists tell them that we are wrong and they are right. They brainwash them and take them to study groups away from the mosque where they learn to hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Their teachings are extremely severe. To appreciate this, you should know that they say things like, 'Those who have AIDS and want to embrace Islam, the best thing they can do is go to Palestine, strap a bomb to themselves, and blow themselves up.' \"\n",

And if we had not sold their rulers armaments on such favourable terms, and with so little forethought? Cruelly evil though they were, I find that I have to understand the events of September 11 as a judgment upon us; and so, to understand these weeks, this Christmas, as a critical moment, an opportunity for a fresh beginning, its character caught in those words we have read: \"Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state \n",
      "governments -- and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition \n",
      "cripples human dignity -- is brewing in Oregon, where a federal judge \n",
      "recently issued a court order to block U.S. Attorney General John \n",
      "Ashcroft from interfering with the state's physician-assisted suicide \n",
      "law.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Declaring that physician-assisted suicide \"was not a legitimate \n",
      "medical purpose for prescribing drugs,\" Ashcroft -- who earier had \n",
      "promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the \n",
      "states -- had threatened to have the medical licenses of \n",
      "participating doctors revoked.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Many civil libertarians, understandably, see Ashcroft's threat as a \n",
      "direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive \n",
      "to allow government interference between doctor and patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (member, Independent \n",
      "Institute Board of Advisors), the fundamental problem is that our \n",
      "laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide -- \n",
      "except, as in the case of Oregon, when it is physician-assisted, and \n",
      "even then only under limited circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, no matter how painfully one may suffer from a \n",
      "terminal illness, one's ultimate choice must be prescribed by a \n",
      "physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of \n",
      "those law-abiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to \n",
      "take its course is too long and too painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drug and suicide law reform, however, would help restore genuine \n",
      "dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain. \"Physician-assisted \n",
      "suicide,\" writes Szasz in a new op-ed, \"is but one of the \n",
      "consequences of our drug laws.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By expanding their range of lawful options, drug and suicide law \n",
      "reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into \n",
      "their own hands without interference from the state. It would also \n",
      "help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the \n",
      "Hippocratic Oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real \n",
      "dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us,\" \n",
      "Szasz concludes. \"The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over \n",
      "in silence or, more often, are unrecognized. We avoid confronting \n",

      "Recognizing the ever growing need for greater operating efficiencies in the trade receivables market, Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions has created a new initiative to develop products and services to assist companies wishing to outsource their credit function. The market, estimated at $75 trillion globally, has a high transaction volume and a costly credit approval process, driving companies to look externally for solutions to increase efficiencies. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"For any company currently in the trade receivables market, credit processes are too slow, manually intensive and limited in scope, \" says Roy Taub, executive managing director of Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions.  \"Standard & Poor's has the capabilities, expertise and systems in place to deliver an efficient, on-line, short-term credit analysis service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The new initiative, led by a Santa Fe, NM based team, will provide clients with an end-to-end solution to manage the trade receivable cycle; including tools for origination, portfolio management and securitization.  Recently, Standard & Poor's acquired the flagship trade receivable management system from Credit2B.  \"With this new capability, Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions can offer tools to help clients measure and manage credit risk exposure across the full spectrum of maturities,\" said Camilo Gomez, PhD, managing director of Standard & Poor's new team and formerly Vice President of data and analytics at Credit2B, a company he helped start. \n",
      " \n",
      "In addition to serving direct sellers, the trade receivable management system will also help financial institutions involved in trade receivables to manage their portfolios of receivables and, as an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution, will allow them to provide services to their clients.  \"By leveraging the Credit2B assets with Standard & Poor's own expertise in asset securitization, we can provide sellers with a one-stop solution to assess the risk they take with trade receivables, help monitor it on a continual basis and provide financial institutions with the tools to develop customized financial products for their customers.\" said Dr. Gomez. \n",
      " \n",
      "The new service will add to the existing quantitative capabilities from Risk Solutions, including: CreditModel ? in Europe, North America and Japan, an exclusive Default Filter license with IQ Financial in Asia, default and recovery data and analysis and an expanded quantitative staff in both London and New York.  \n",

      "QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the\n",
      "return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact\n",
      "that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's\n",
      "effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance\n",
      "keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots\n",
      "have a bye in week 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second\n",
      "consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254\n",
      "passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks\n",
      "good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and\n",
      "Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris\n",
      "Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his\n",
      "upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season\n",
      "should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.\n",
      "\n",
      "QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van\n",
      "Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to\n",
      "match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against\n",
      "weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers\n",
      "this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes\n",
      "has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with\n",
      "147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against\n",
      "Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season\n",
      "is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look\n",
      "for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with\n",
      "153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith\n",
      "away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season\n",
      "will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to\n",
      "bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for\n",
      "the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the\n",
      "season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will\n",
      "become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the\n",
      "talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the\n",
      "remainder of the season.\n",
      "\n",

      "RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing\n",
      "yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106\n",
      "rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on\n",
      "Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see\n",
      "20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs\n",
      "as long as he remains healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he\n",
      "is 100% healthy for the first time this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the\n",
      "lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,\n",
      "the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What\n",
      "happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2\n",
      "touchdowns).\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with\n",
      "101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play\n",
      "threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in\n",
      "mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week\n",
      "and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him\n",
      "in dynasty leagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock\n",
      "on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks\n",
      "should quiet the critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday\n",
      "with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1\n",
      "receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the\n",
      "season.\n",
      "\n",
      "WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent\n",
      "basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown\n",
      "continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New\n",
      "England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the\n",

      "with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was\n",
      "unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With\n",

      "starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the\n",
      "last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to\n",
      "be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.\n",
      "McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some\n",
      "plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy\n",
      "quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will\n",
      "drop quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is\n",
      "directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game\n",
      "with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.\n",
      "However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver\n",

      "Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring\n",
      "injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is\n",
      "not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me\n",
      "to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy\n",
      "hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two\n",
      "weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that\n",
      "game.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the\n",
      "Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,\n",
      "Smith's numbers will remain meager.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option\n",
      "in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had\n",
      "26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5\n",
      "receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the\n",
      "Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone\n",
      "else to the roster.\n",

      "return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries\n",
      "and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later\n",
      "this week.\n",

      "WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after\n",
      "being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of\n",

But not only did the Taliban turn out to be a paper tiger, Afghanistan has been a proving ground for a new American operational approach towards inconvenient regimes--isolate the target state diplomatically, build up the internal opposition, insert special forces, bring on the air power, dislodge the enemy's conventional forces, get them on the run, pummel them, send in the Marines, and let the opposition do the rest.\n",

      "Just in time for the end of the year (and the Pulitzer entries), the New York Times (link requires registration) publishes a very long (6,000 words plus) and detailed narrative of America's failed antiterror policies, from 1993 to 2001. The Clinton administration part of that story is familiar: The administration was aware of the growing threat from al Qaeda, and took some steps to counter it, but was too distracted by the president's quest for a \"legacy,\" and by his actual legacy (impeachment) to give the matter the kind of sustained attention it needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting detail, though, is that President Bush was actually ahead of the curve, though alas, not by nearly enough:\n",
      "\n",
      "*** QUOTE ***\n",
      "\n",
      "Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda. In July, [Condoleezza] Rice said, Mr. Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to \"swatting at flies.\" He said he wanted a plan to \"bring this guy down.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Documents found in Kabul houses show that al Qaeda had tested chemical weapons, including cyanide gas, on animals, the Times of London reports. Al Qaeda's knowledge of how to make weapons of mass destruction appears to have been \"crude\" and the studies \"were the work of a variety of autonomous cells, who conducted their own experiments, without collusion.\" The Times quotes an \"intelligence expert\" as saying that \"this proves a huge problem to the Western security forces. What we can see is the work of different, potentially self-replicating cells, united only by an ideal. They will be far more difficult to extinguish than a centrally organized terrorist force.\"\n",

      "\"The FBI is conducting more than 150 separate investigations into groups and individuals in the United States with possible ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda organization,\" the Washington Post reports. \"The domestic targets include dozens of people who are under electronic surveillance through national security warrants, and others who are being watched by undercover agents attempting to learn more about their activities and associates, officials said.\" Frustratingly but understandably, officials are saying little about the specifics of the investigations.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"After stoking high expectations that the federal takeover of airport security would lead to a new breed of airport security screener, one who was better educated and more qualified to assume a position of increased responsibility, the Department of Transportation has decided not to impose rules that would displace thousands of current screeners,\" the New York Times reports. In particular, screeners won't have to have high school diplomas; a year's work experience--including experience in the much-derided pre-Sept. 11 airport-security system--will suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea is to allow current screeners who would otherwise qualify but may not have high school diplomas to be eligible, so they do not get left behind,\" explains the Transportation Department's Paul Takemoto. Well, pardon us if this is a rude question, but wasn't the whole idea of federalizing airport security to leave the old, inadequate screeners behind?\n",

      "A pair of Los Angeles Times articles floats the theory that alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid was more sophisticated than he appeared. \"He had one most important trait: He was very calm in an extremely stressful situation,\" Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert from Scotland, tells the Times. The paper adds that \"even his down-and-out appearance may have been a reverse undercover strategy, based on a calculation that he looked too obvious to be a real threat.\" Bolstering this view is an account in the London  Observer  http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,625868,00.html :\n",

      "As he passed through security at Charles de Gaulle, an employee of ICTS, the private firm policing the airport, was suspicious. His profile--a lone traveller, who bought his ticket in cash and had no baggage--raised an automatic red flag. His knapsack contained only a Koran, a Walkman with religious tapes and a magazine. Reid claimed he was visiting relatives. He explained his lack of luggage by saying his family had ample clothes for him. The interrogation took so long he missed his flight. He stayed in a hotel at the airline's expense. There had been no body search and no sniffer dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Reid turned up two hours early for the 10.40 flight. This time security staff--recognising him from the previous day--waved him through.\n",

      "\n",
      "The  second L.A. Times story  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-122901tatp.story  says that Reid's shoes were actually \"a relatively sophisticated explosive device,\" though \"not beyond the capability of an individual acting alone.\" The  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/30/News/News.40789.html  adds that the explosive \"was similar to that developed and used by Hamas in suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks.\"\n",

      "Another Observer piece  http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,625797,00.html  says that Britain's MI5 intelligence agency \"knew of links between shoe bomber Richard Reid and one 11 September hijack suspect late last year, but failed to track Reid before he tried to blow up an airliner, according to US intelligence reports.\" MI5 \"intercepted phone calls between Reid and the suspect, Zacarias Moussaoui, which directly linked Bromley-born Reid to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda net work, but did not realise their implication until it was too late,\" according to the report.\n",

      "Reid converted to Islam while in prison, and Britain's prisons turn out to be breeding grounds for Islamic extremism, according to a series of reports in the London press. The Telegraph notes that the British government \"ignored specific warnings more than a year ago that Muslim extremists were infiltrating prisons and recruiting inmates.\" And the  Times  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570019-2001603123,00.html  reports that Muslim clerics preaching in British prisons have been told \"that they were being watched carefully after two were suspended for allegedly delivering anti-American sermons to young inmates after the September 11 attacks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Telegraph op-ed piece,  Jonathan Aitken  http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/nmus230.xml , a former Conservative member of Parliament who served a prison term for perjury, says that during his time behind bars, \"on four occasions, fellow prisoners who were Muslim came to talk to me to see if I would be interested in converting to Islam.\" Aitken says he had no encounters with Muslim militants, but he observes that \"the Richard Reid case is anything but an exception. Rather, it is the militant face of a much broader phenomenon: the Islamic mission that is a new and astonishing feature of British prison life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore Dalrymple  http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/story.html?f=/stories/20011229/990690.html , a British physician who treats prisoners, explains Islam's appeal to prisoners: \"Bonversion to Islam kills two birds with one stone. It fulfils a personal need, but it is also an act of revenge upon society: for official multiculturalism notwithstanding, everyone knows that Western societies are profoundly uneasy about their infiltration by an increasingly confident and militant Islam that uses Western liberal principles to spread itself in the way communism once did.\"\n",

      "Perhaps in mulling over Walker's life, he will try to remember when he was a 20-year-old. True, he did not defiantly challenge the system as so many young protesters did in the Vietnam War era. Politics was not his bag at Yale when others were marching in support of civil rights and against the war.\n",

      "Nor had he yet found religion as the guiding light of his life. He surely knows he was a different person back then. The president has often sought to dismiss his youthful escapades with the cute tautology: \"When I was young and foolish, I was young and foolish.\"\n",

      "More important, Thomas's logic is morally slovenly. Why is Walker entitled to more compassion than the Afghans, Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens and other natives of Muslim lands who've fought for the Taliban and al Qaeda? If anything, a far better argument can be made that they are victims of circumstance, having had an upbringing in an environment that encourages Islamic fanaticism. Walker, on the other hand, plainly chose to abandon his country and join its enemies.\n",

You couldn't shrug, turn your palms upward, and appeal to some abstraction over which you had no control--the nation's irresistible suburbanization, say, or the Internet's inevitable dissolution of the cities--to absolve yourself for failure. Assuming, as Giuliani assumed, that talented, entrepreneurial people would always like to live near one another for the electricity such closeness generates, he took responsibility for creating the conditions in which that could keep happening in the place proverbially paved with gold.

      "From: Bank Technology News\n",
      "Aug 28, 2001\n",

      "\n",
      "German investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW) has purchased\n",
      "analytic software that, it hopes, will put it on the cutting edge of risk\n",
      "management. \n",
      "\n",
      "WhiteLight Systems, the Palo Alto, CA-based company, has announced that the\n",
      "investment bank selected analytics and Web reporting software for a global\n",
      "risk management solution in a licences and services contract valued at $2.3\n",
      "million. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bank is using WhiteLight to develop applications that will help control\n",
      "the bank's exposure to risk. DrKW hopes the applications will improve the\n",
      "visibility of data about its investment banking portfolio, such as foreign\n",
      "exchange, equities and derivatives, to a much wider range of business\n",
      "decision makers across the global business and provide a more flexible\n",
      "system for interrogating the data. The bank also expects the new\n",
      "applications to uncover new product and market opportunities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The initial project involves developing three applications: credit risk,\n",
      "market risk and product control. Based on WhiteLight's AnalyticServer, DrKW\n",
      "will roll out the applications in 2001 across its major international\n",
      "trading centers, including Frankfurt, London, New York and Tokyo.\n",
      "AnalyticServer's multi-dimensional modeling engine is at the core of\n",
      "WhiteLight's application suite. It is designed to allow complex interactive\n",
      "analysis within large and varying data sources. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, DrKW has selected iApplicationServer, WhiteLight's solution\n",
      "for Web-based analytics, to enable DrKW's decision makers worldwide to\n",
      "operate from a unified global view of business data. Using\n",
      "iApplicationServer, the German bank will be able to create and deploy\n",
      "interactive reports to any user on the Web. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bank is not talking about its purchase, but Peter Beard, WhiteLight's\n",
      "vice president of world wide sales, could confirm that DrKW is our biggest\n",
      "physical user in the world. It has 25 WhiteLight servers in production, and\n",
      "it has purchased the largest number of our servers within our customer base,\n",
      "in the shortest amount of time. Other project areas within the bank are\n",
      "looking at how to use WhiteLight. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other European banks are considering buying the technology, developed as the\n",
      "next step up from online analytical processing (OLAP), which is regarded as\n",
      "increasingly unwieldy and inflexible in the wake of the e-business\n",
      "revolution. Merrill Lynch predicts that the total e- business analytics\n",
      "market opportunity will top $25.1 billion by 2004. \n",
      "\n",
      "Growing market \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a fact that the scope of business is ever expanding, from the size of\n",
      "an institution's operations to the markets and customers it can reach. At\n",
      "the same time, market conditions and customer requirements change rapidly,\n",
      "and there are more factors and variables to be considered before decisions\n",
      "can be made, WhiteLight says. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gartner analysts agree and they predict significant growth in the predictive\n",
      "analytics business. By 2005, enterprises will need three times as many\n",
      "professionals on their analytic staff as they need today, Gartner believes,\n",
      "and the demand for analytic talent today outweighs supply by at least two to\n",
      "one. The killer trend for e-business will likely be the real-time\n",
      "enterprise, i.e. an enterprise able to collect nearly instantaneous feedback\n",
      "on business processes and to take the right adaptive, corrective or\n",
      "preventative action. Web analytics enables executives and managers to know\n",
      "where the company stands in its quest to become a real-time enterprise and\n",
      "when the company will achieve real-time business capability across all\n",
      "channels, from the shop floor to the e-marketplace says Gartner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, a new generation of analytic applications, dubbed predictive\n",
      "analytics, is needed to help managers understand what is happening and why,\n",
      "and to test the outcome of prospective decisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "WhiteLight's Analytic Application Suite has been developed to allow the\n",
      "near-instant extraction of critical and previously unavailable\n",
      "decision-support information from large and complex databases, the company\n",
      "says. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is still very new and can be categorized as an early adopter market, says\n",
      "Beard of the technology. People are looking at two scenarios. There are\n",
      "those companies that want to be leading edge, or those which have used\n",
      "traditional methods (of risk management) and found their limits. With\n",
      "operational risk, the only way to do anything remotely like we do is with\n",
      "Excel, and it results in the 25-page spreadsheet from hell which only one or\n",
      "two people in the company can understand. We can put the data on a server\n",
      "rather than a desktop and all users are permitted to see all facets.\n",
      "Business managers or analysts don't need to know SQL to create\n",
      "multi-dimensional models. They can define formulas and data sources using a\n",
      "drag and drop interface. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to Beard, All the products that have grown up over the last 10\n",
      "years have been what I call rearview mirror technology. It's historical\n",
      "data, looking at where you have come from. Predictive analytics takes the\n",
      "same data, but in increasingly large volumes and puts it into a model so\n",
      "that analysts can interact with that. What if, for example, there were to be\n",
      "a change in the underlying rate by 10 basis points? You can make the change\n",
      "and see the impact across the entire model. \n",
      "\n",
      "Growing interest \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the impact of predictive analytics on DrKW's bottom line is not yet\n",
      "known, WhiteLight says that one of its clients involved in loan\n",
      "collateralization believes it will be able to return $20 million to the\n",
      "balance sheet thanks to the software. Financial institutions will also be\n",
      "able to hang onto costly legacy systems, says Beard. Every bank has legacy\n",
      "systems on which they have spent millions. We sit above that in a platform.\n",
      "Pertinent data is modeled within the WhiteLight server. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other financial institutions in Europe are keen to follow in DrKW's\n",
      "footsteps, says Beard, who already counts Barclays, J.P. Morgan Chase and\n",
      "Lehman Brothers among his company's customers. We are involved in a major\n",
      "project with a large multi-national Dutch bank with the same profile as\n",
      "DrKW. It is an existing customer with whom we will be putting the technology\n",
      "group wide. It owns a number of other banks across Germany and Holland. And\n",
      "over the next month we will be able to announce three new contracts in\n",
      "Switzerland, Germany and Holland. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has created a groundswell of\n",
      "interest in predictive analytic applications with its new Basel Capital\n",
      "Accord. The accord is based on three pillars that allow banks to evaluate\n",
      "properly the various risks they face. It focuses on minimum capital\n",
      "requirements, the supervisory review of an institution's capital adequacy\n",
      "and market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and\n",
      "sound banking practices, according to the BIS. The new accord will be\n",
      "finalized at the end of the year, and is expected to be implemented in\n",
      "member jurisdictions by 2004. \n",
      "\n",
      "It will be a real benefit to banks if they can reduce the amount of\n",
      "provision they must have. It is a clearly defined initiative with massive\n",
      "tangible benefits, says Beard. \n",

      " \n",
      "The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta announced that Clinton has proven that you can get sex from Aides.  Gennifer Flowers was asked if her relationship with Clinton was anything like Monica Lewinski's. She replied, \"Close, but no cigar.\"  The FBI has coined a technical term for the stains found on Monica's dress: \"Presidue.\"  \n",
      "Clinton now recruits interns from only four colleges: Moorhead, Oral Roberts, Ball State and Brigham Young.  Did you know that Clinton had asked to change the Democratic emblem from a donkey to a condom? It represents inflation, halts production, and gives you a false sense of security while you are being screwed.  Arkansas is very proud of Bill Clinton. All these women coming forward ,and not one is his sister! \n",
      "Finally, Hillary Clinton recently went to a fortuneteller who intoned, \"Prepare to become widow. Your husband will soon suffer a violent death!\"  Hillary took a deep breath and asked, \"Will I be acquitted?\" \n",

      "\n",
      "Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' \"insider trading proceeds\") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any \"freeze\" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult \"tracing\" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., \"trace\" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).\n",
      "\n",
      "The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of \"an equitable accounting,\" wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, \"particularly as to . . . Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow.\"\n",

      "By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable acts that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of the numbers coming out of New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. \n",

      "\n",
      "* The Pentagon - \n",
      "\n",
      "Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon. The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing 99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low, too early to affect a large portion of the building.On top of that, the section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had recently completed straightening and blast-proofing, savinguntold lives. This attack was sad, but a statistical failure. \n",

      "*** The Planes *** \n",
      "\n",
      "* American Airlines Flight 77 \n",
      "This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats were empty. \n",

      "\n",
      "* United Airlines Flight 93 \n",
      "\n",
      "This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had 84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving untold numbers of lives in the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "*** In Summary *** \n",
      "Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants - all common, survivable illnesses \n",
      "\n",
      "The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives. \n",
