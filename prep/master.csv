947,"     As per our conversation last week, I just wanted to double check on a potential raise before the deal closes on Friday. I know that more than a few non-promotional raises have been offered and accepted for the transfer to UBS, and I'd like to make absolutely sure that I'm not eligible for one. As Cowan says, potentially the bonus pool may be much bigger next year, which is great, but it's not for sure. And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.",188.txt,no_entity,655,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,1,1,0,0,0,7,171.0,8,655,3,4,2,2,0,0,1,1,0.2857142857142857,0.5,3.8304093567251463,0,1,0,0

1783,"3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place.

1786,"5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow ""form of agreement"".
