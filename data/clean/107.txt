Greg,


Further to my email to you earlier today, we have tracked down the reasons for the discrepancies in the termination dates in your list versus the chart we have prepared.  In many instances, that contract was reviewed by BCG, and it was determined that the wrong termination date was set, given the provisions of the contract.  I understand that a memo with respect to this issue likely was forwarded to ECC by Chris Christopher and John Eamon on January 8, 2002 ( a copy of which is attached), which set out that based on our review of the contracts, the following parties and their proper termination dates are:

AEC Marketing, physical, gas  - February 1, 2002
Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical, gas - February 1, 2002
El Paso Merchant Energy, physical gas - February 1, 2002
Williams Energy Marketing & Trade Co. - February 1, 2002

Our review last night also revealed the following:
Baytex physical, gas- ECC list says terminated January 6/02, but the January 4/02 letter from ECC set a termination date of January 8/02, which is reflected in the Chart

Marathon Canada Limited physical, gas - ECC list says terminated December 18/01, however the chart suggests that this was revised by a letter from ECC, sent December 31, 01, changing the termination date to January 4/02.  Chris Christopher recalls the letter, but we do not have a copy of that letter.

Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Orbit) physical, gas - we have reviewed the contract and determined that the chart is incorrect.  It has been changed from February 1/02 to December 18/01, as set out in the ECC list.

I understand that you have reviewed the Cinergy contract and determined the reason for the discrepancy in that instance.

We continue our review of a couple of entries, namely Canadian Natural Resources, Talisman Energy Inc, and Dynegy Canada.  The remainder of the list was either consistent with the Chart, or had no entry and was therefore updated with your information.

Thank you for forwarding this to our attention.
