Rick Buy had a conversation with Pug Winokur yesterday in which Pug requested that a change in the Transaction Approval Process be effected immediately so that all divestitures in excess of $50 million be presented to the Board for its approval.    This change means that this transaction will need to go the the Board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
