Houston found another small dispute for Dec. 2001 with BPA.  

Please see the attached.  

In sum, based on BPA's figures, it looks like we doubled up by adding numbers from the 25th to numbers for the 26th (hence, doubling the 26th)
According to them:

12/26
Deal 381345 = 600 MW total (not 1200) 
Deal 380414.1 = 200 MW total (not 400)

Please check the scheduling sheets and let me know if you agree.

#sig#Thanks!  Jenny
