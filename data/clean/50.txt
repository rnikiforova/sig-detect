I attach an updated list (to Feb 5) of the terminated contracts to date.  F=
or informational purposes, I have added a column that sets out the settleme=
nt dates for contracts we have settled, so there may be some additional cou=
nterparties added to my previous list where there was no ECC agreed termina=
tion date but we have settled and terminated (no one needs to do anything f=
or these c/ps).  Again, the first table sets forth the physical contracts t=
hat have been terminated and the second sets out the financial contracts, a=
nd all data reflects ECC's (not the counterparties') perception of the worl=
d.  I have vetted my list against Blakes' master list and believe this is a=
ccurate in all respects.  As I indicated in my previous e-mails to you ther=
e were a few date discrepancies and I have previously provided you with the=
 corrected dates for El Paso, Marathon, AEC Marketing, Calpine (Encal), Wil=
liams Energy and Baytex (all physical), all which are now correctly reflect=
ed in the attachment.  A few others that were not previously on the list in=
clude Coast Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2 and PrimeWest =
Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2. =20
