Hi Garth,
we don't know the reason for these 'fault' appearances, yet. It has to do 
with the communication between PC and PLC.
But : it did not influence the status of the turbine, neither it shuts down, 
nor downtime counts up.
In version 1x629 the solve the problem, but the real cause is not solves, 
until now. Clemens will work on it.

What's the time schedule for updating V1x629 ?
