Monica, 
Just wanted to say hi.? Jenn moved to Houston last Thursday.? We were busy 
getting her apartment set up over the holiday weekend, but she still has a 
long way to go.? She started her new job today at Conoco.? We went to watch 
fireworks last night in downtown Houston.? It was pretty cool.? They had 
the Beach Boys there.? It looks like she may be buying a new car soon. 
Hers is not doing so well.? In fact, she is borrowing my Celica right now. 
I hope y'all had a good Fourth, and tell Bryan we said hi.
