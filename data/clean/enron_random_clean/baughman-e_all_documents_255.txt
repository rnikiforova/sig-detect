SUBJECT:  AUTHORIZED POWER MARKETING PERSONNEL OF MANITOBA HYDRO

For the past three years, Minnesota Power-MPEX has been providing real time 
power trading services for Manitoba Hydro.  The original goals of the 
arrangement between Manitoba Hydro and MPEX have been reached and Manitoba 
Hydro personnel will re-assume all power trading responsibilities effective 
March 18, 2001 at 00:00:00.
Attached is an updated list of Manitoba Hydro's authorized power marketers 
and power traders. This list will remain in effect until further notice.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (204)

your most recent list of authorized power marketing contacts.
