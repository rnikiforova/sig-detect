Kayne,  

We are still having problems in the morning with the Hourly books not being 
flat.  Could you please talk to the guys again and stress the importance of 
flattening the books.  We are having to run our reports multiple times which 
causes us to spend most of our morning dealing with these issues.  Again, I 
think the guys need to know that we have a 12 pm deadline.  If we are late, 
our group gets written up and we have to report why we were late.  

#sig#Thanks for you help.
