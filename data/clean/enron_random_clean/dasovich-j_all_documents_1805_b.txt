Likely needs to be a legal analysis based on the language of the original 
decision etablishing the credits.  But seems to me that we have a deal with 
our customers to receive service according to price, terms and conditions 
stated in our contracts with those customers, and that the contract language 
would govern how the credit is treated.  If  the contracts don't speak to the 
issue of credits, seems that our contract agrees to provide rez customers 
with service for a a certain price, and as such, it would be up to us whether 
we flow it through.  But a lawyer, I am not.  Are our contracts silent on the 
issue?
