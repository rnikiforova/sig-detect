Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.
