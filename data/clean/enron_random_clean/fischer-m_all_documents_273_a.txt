Hallo Zusammen,

I received a document from our operations department that shows the occurence 
of faults at the Mill Run site for the month of April. There are a number of 
"undocumented" fault/status messages that are logged frequently:

"EM247" 102 times
"EM242" 102 times
"EM238" 101 times
"EM237" 101 times
"EM235" 101 times
"EM312" 56 times
"EM280" 56 times
"EM248" 56 times
"EM304" 52 times
"EM272" 52 times
"EM311" 51 times
"EM306" 51 times
"EM302" 51 times
"EM301" 51 times
"EM299" 51 times
"EM279" 51 times
"EM274" 51 times
"EM270" 51 times
"EM240" 51 times
"EM269" 50 times
"EM267" 50 times

Most of these fault were logged on turbine 5 and turbine 6 (with a few on 
turbine 7). They are not distributed between all the turbines but isolated on 
a few.

The major question that that operations asked me was which production 
statistic timer was incremented when these conditions were logged. My guess 
is that since none of these stop the turbine that the "OK" timer continued to 
increment. Is this correct? 

The question that I have is: what is causing so many of these messages in the 
log? Do these status messages have any specific meaning? According to the 
documentation there are only about 220 messages that have descriptions in the 
error list data base (in VisuPro v1.27.0.0). Where are the other messages 
coming from? (This is version 13527 Bachmann software.) I think this issue 
was brought up several months ago but I don't think we got any additional 
information.
