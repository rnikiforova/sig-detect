If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are 
eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed 
your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial 
associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation 
that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the 
Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these 
promotion guidelines going forward.
