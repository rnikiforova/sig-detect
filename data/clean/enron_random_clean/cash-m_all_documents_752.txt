Jeffrey,

We think that we will be in Austin from Sunday to Tuesday.  We made plans 
yesterday to spend Sunday evening with some friends from law school.  At some 
point, I will have lunch with Maria Morris Stewart (my roommate from Tulane) 
who lives in Austin.  We still are free on Monday evening, if that works for 
you.  I think that we will stay at that Hawthorne Suites on MoPac, but we may 
splurge for the Four Seasons -- no firm plans as of yet!!

Of course, Trey has to have his Hyde Park fix at soem point as well.

Let me know your plans.  Sooner would be better, because we are trying to 
finalize things.
