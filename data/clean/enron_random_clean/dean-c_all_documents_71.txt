We had a quiet, uneventful fourth.? We helped my parents move to Humble over 
the weekend and then came home Monday afternoon.? This weekend we're headed 
to Dallas to see friends.? Bryan, Brackhahn, Tom Kimpel, Jenn Price, and some 
of our friends are going to the Metallica concert on Sunday.? 

If we don't see y'all this summer, then we'll have to get together for the 
first football game on September 9th. 

Take care and tell Jenn we said hello.

#sig#--Monica, Bryan, & Tori
