HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the 
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new 
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  

Hebrews 4:12 - 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that 
God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to 
the swift, 
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my 
sisters!
