Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
