Were able to convince the air board yesterday that the testing done to the #4 
heater should be thrown out due to procedures not followed. The other company 
did not do the sampling at the correct elevation in the stack,as well as 
problems found with the calibrations of his equipment. The air board agreed 
to disregard all testing done by the first company. We completed the testing 
on the #4 heater late yesterday, using Aeros, and passed without a problem. 
We were going to also test the #2 heater yesterday, but the air board 
requested we wait until next week as we were getting a late start. There were 
not going to be any additional fines for the delayed testing due to it was at 
the air board's request. 
I will let you know how next week goes.
#sig#Thanks again for the help.
