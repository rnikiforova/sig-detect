Elsie:

Sorry, in looking over this again with Lisa, we want to be sure that we understand the request correctly.  

See attached for my understanding of what you are requesting and please confirm.

I looked at this from the perspective of each entire deal.  For each, I took the total price and volume of the deal and subtracted/added the MWs you specified and then calculated the revised value of each deal.  

Is this a correct understanding of the changes needed and their impact?

#sig#Thanks, Jenny
