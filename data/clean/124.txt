	All Enron personnel currently allowed access to this room need to retain that access until, and unless, their employment with Enron is terminated.
	Any access restrictions, or additions, should still be cleared by myself or Bill Bradford, subject to the above limitations.

	Please give me a call if you have further questions.

#sig#	Thanks,
