Hi Sabrina.  

  Sorry it has taken me a while to get back to you on this.  Jenny Thome and Lisa Gang are working on Avista true-up from Jan '02 thru current. I believe that this pre-payment for $899,464.00 is for the week of Jan 1 thru Jan 7, 2002.  Mo - can you please confirm this?  The wire transfer request is pending 26, but  just says prepay without a trade date.  Payment was made 12/21/02.
