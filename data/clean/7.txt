> have regarding the gold sector:
>
> *	"Gold stocks are way ahead of the gold price - what's going on?"
>
> *	"The US dollar remains strong - how can gold rally?"
>
> *	"How can gold stocks rally when inflation remains so tame?"
>
> The following charts (found in the attached Word document - sourced
> from Bloomberg) illustrate the relationship of gold stocks and bullion
> to several other important variables: $US, CRB, CPI, and TSE Metals
> and Minerals Index.
>
> We hope that you will agree with our conclusions that based on the
> response of these variables at the end of the last recession:
>
> 1) It is reasonable to see bullion lag the gold stocks in this
> economic environment (end of Fed easing).
>
> 2) Gold/gold stocks CAN rally in the face of a strong US dollar.
>
> 3) Gold/gold stocks rise on the threat of inflation - not necessarily
> the appearance of inflation itself.
