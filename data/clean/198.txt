Paula,  Tim Detmering talked with Jeff McMahon about this the other night, but Tim isn't in today so I don't know what they decided.  However, in October it was decided by Rick Buy and Pug Winokur that this was not a board action item.  I know a lot has changed since then, so if we want to take this to the board this time we will prepare the information as you suggest.  Would you re-check with Jeff McMahon and Rick Buy and confirm that this will be a board agenda item.  In the interim, Steve Harper will get the listed items in a package.
