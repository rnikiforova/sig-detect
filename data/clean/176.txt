Lisa:

In the message below, Settlements in Houston is confirming that we have the correct understanding of the dispute concerning BPA in Dec. 01 (see the e-mail and spreadsheet I copied to you on May 30).  Let me know if you have questions as you research it.  

Also, do you need anything else from Settlements to enable you to work on the Hafslund request (see my email from May 29).

Note - I am out of the office until Monday.

#sig#Have a good weekend.  Jenny
