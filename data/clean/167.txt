Portland Employees-

At this time Enron Portland has 5 parking spots allocated based on floor space and number of employees.  As UBS employees leave we do not automatically have the ability to take over their spots.  However, in renegotiating our lease with PGE we will address the possibility of taking over more that the 5 allocated spots.  We will keep you updated as to the progress of this.  For now, Khymberly Booth is checking into the availability of 1 or more of our spots and will offer any available spots to Portland employees based on Portland office seniority.  We will contact you individually if a spot becomes available.  If you have any questions please contact Kathy Sheppard or Khymberly Booth.
